<H1>2020 </H1> <br> This is a future history scenario (as of July 2009). The United States has suffered the worst economic crash in history. In order to keep its government in tact, the U.S. has been forced to pull back all of its foreign influence and has ceased to exist as a great world power. <br> With America's absense, Canada has become the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere. Many of America's former allies have sided with Canada. In Russia, the Communist party has once again taken control of the government. Many of the Middle Eastern nations have allied with Russia and together they are facing west towards Europe and Africa. <br> In Asia, China has become the most dominant power after gaining the support of India, Mongolia and Indonesia. These nations have formed the East Asian Alliance, containing 3/5 of the world's population. The East Asians have allied with the Russian coalition against the Western Democracies. Another World War is on the horizon. It's Canada and the European Union versus Russia and China! <br><br> There is no tech and Turkey is connected to Balkans. All other standard Revised rules apply. <br>Enjoy! - adoY<br>Added Victory Conditions-Roger Cooper
